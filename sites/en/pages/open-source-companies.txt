<h2>Open Source Companies</h2>

I am not really sure what <b>Open Source Companies</b> are.

Are these companies that have no propriatery code at all?
I dobut there are many companies without any propriatery code, but I'd love to know about them.

Companies that build some Open Source project that is the core part of their business?

Companies with a significant code-base they have released under some Open Source license?

Companies that contribute to Open Source?

<h2>Companies</h2>

<a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> has a bunch of Open Source projects in <a href="https://github.com/twitter">GitHub</a>.
As I see many of the projects use Scala, Rust, but there are a few in Python and in Golang as well. I also saw Ruby, JavaScript, Objective-C and a few more
language.

In my mind <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a> was this super-proprietary company, so I was surprised to see it as one of the companies with the largest number of
Open Source projects.  As of today they have almost 500 repositories on <a href="https://github.com/adobe">GitHub</a>. Though I am not sure how important these projects are.
I see a lot of projects in JavaScript, and some in other languages such as Java, TypeScript, Objective-C, Python, Dart.
